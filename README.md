## What is Bevy Vector Shapes?
Bevy Vector Shapes is a library for easily and ergonomically creating instanced vector shapes in [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

## WARNING
Bevy Vector Shapes is in the very early stages of development. There may be issues and some documentation may be sparse.

## Features
- Variety of shape types: lines, rectangles, circles, arcs and regular polygons.
- Supports various bevy rendering features: 2D and 3D pipelines, transparency, alpha modes, render layers, bloom.
- Immediate and retained mode.
- Local anti-aliasing for smoother looking shapes.
- Optional billboarding for each shape type to ensure they are always facing the camera.
- Shapes of the same type and rendering configuration are fully instanced together.
- Compilation to wasm to run your projects in the browser.

## Usage
See the `minimal_2d` or `minimal_3d` examples for basic usage and the remaining examples for explorations of supported features.
